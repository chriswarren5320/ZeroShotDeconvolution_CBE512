This folder contains a blood vessel data set. 
The image files include raw data and results of richardson-lucy, sparse deconvolution, ZSdeconv,  and ZSdeonv w/ hessian regularization. 
The matlab script isolates as linear cross section of the vessel and plots the relative pixel intesity across that path to characterize deconvolution performance.
