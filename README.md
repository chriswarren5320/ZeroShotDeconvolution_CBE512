# ZeroShotDeconvolution - characterizing model performance with various deconvolution regularization terms, benchmarked against gold standard deconvolution algorithms. 

This code is my implementation/modification of of a previously published "self-supervised deep-learning tool for instant denoising and super-resolution in optical fluorescence microscopy"

Credit is due to https://tristazeng.github.io/ZS-DeconvNet-page/, from which this code was modified.  

This package includes the Python implementation of training and inference, and MATLAB implementation of training data generation and simulation of PSF. 

This repository contains the code used to implement, modify, and test the ZS-Deconvnet denoising and deconvolution algorthim on simulated datasets and biological samples from our lab.
